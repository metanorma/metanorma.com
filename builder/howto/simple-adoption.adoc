== How can I adapt the StanDoc toolchain for my own publications?

THE FOLLOWING IS OBSOLETE, MIKL TO UPDATE

[TIP]
====
.Summary
The easiest way to adopt StanDoc is to use the metanorma-acme gem: https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-acme, supplying your own stylesheets and HTML files for styling. This gem includes a YAML file where you can customise behaviour of the flavour without needing to write any code. It will only deal with fairly simple standards flavours.

External identifier referring to this document.

`:referenceURLID:`::
Identifier embedded into a document type-specific external URL.

`:previous-uri:`::
URI of previous version of the document.

=== Mapping to OGC legacy AsciiDoc

Where these preexisting metanorma attributes correspond to attributes already used
by OGC in their AsciiDoc template, Metanorma-OGC permits those attributes, and they are
treated as synonyms of the Metanorma attributes:

|===
| OGC legacy AsciiDoc | OGC Metanorma AsciiDoc

| `:copyrightYear` | `:copyright-year:`
| `:workingGroup:` | `:workgroup:`
| `:publicationDate:` | `:published-date:`
| `:approvalDate:` | `:issued-date:`
| `:submissionDate:` | `:received-date:`
| `docReference` | `:docnumber:`
| `editor` | `:fullname:`, with `:role:` = `editor`
|===

== Markup

=== Sections

The Normative References section may be named just "`References`", reflecting OGC practice.

=== Preliminary elements

The following clauses are preliminary elements, and are moved into the frontispiece
of the document (in Metanorma, the document preface):

* Abstract
* Keywords
* Preface
* Submitting Organizations
* Submitters

The abstract is recognized as the first clause with an `abstract` style attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[abstract]
== Abstract

xxx
----

The preface is recognized as the text between the AsciiDoc document attributes and
the first AsciiDoc section title; it must not be given a section title of its own.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

.Preface

preface text

=== Submitters
----

Keywords and Submitting Organizations consist of lists. They are treated as document metadata,
and are entered as a document attribute.
The prefatory text introducing them is added automatically.

Submitters are treated as a table, contained in a section with the title `Submitters`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Submitters

|===
|Name |Representing |OGC member

|Steve Liang | University of Calgary, Canada / SensorUp Inc. | Yes
|===
----

=== Examples

Unlike the normal case in Metanorma, examples can have captions:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[example]
.Example caption
====
Text
====
----

=== Recommendations, requirements, and permissions

NOTE: This subsection supplements link:/author/topics/document-format/requirements-recommendations-permissions[Requirement, Recommendation, and Permission blocks] in general Metanorma documentation.

For legacy reasons, a second Metanorma AsciiDoc syntax is permitted for
recommendations, requirements and permissions.

These may also be recognized in Metanorma
AsciiDoc as tables whose first cell contains the text _Recommendation_, _Requirement_, _Permission_,
optionally followed by a number (which is ignored in parsing; the elements are renumbered
automatically in rendering.) These are currently constituted of two elements: an internal
label, which is parsed as the first paragraph of the second table cell, and the body of
the recommendation etc., which is parsed as the remainder of the second table cell.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[recommendation1]]
|===
|Recommendation |/ogc/recommendation/wfs/2 +

If the API definition document uses the OpenAPI Specification 3.0,
the document SHOULD conform to the
<<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0 requirements class>>.

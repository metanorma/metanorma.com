This must be clause 3.

[source,adoc]
----
[[tda]]                      <= anchor if you want it
[source=ISO8601-1]           <= allows inheriting terms and definitions from
another document
== Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviations   <= can combine T&D and S&A

=== Terms and definitions    <= the real T&D clause

[[term-explicit]]            <= anchor if you want it

==== Term entries within a Terms & Definitions section

The structure is strict. The following illustrates the complete structure of a term entry.

In the term source (`[.source]`), all content after the reference and the "`comma`"
is about "`modifications`" to the original definition.

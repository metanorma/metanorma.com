== Choose your starting point

If you'd like to *adopt Metanorma for your organization's standard & specification management workflows*,
the best starting point is to customize an existing processor that
matches your requirements best, such as Metanorma-ISO.

* link:/docs/[Learn more] about Metanorma's features
aiming to help organizations with management of standardization documents

* Check out link:/docs/customization/[Metanorma customization guidelines]

To *author documents compliant with the requirements of certain established standard bodies*,
you may already find an existing Metanorma processor:
see link:/flavors/[Metanormaâ€™s officially supported document flavors]

== Quick install guide

Here is the simplest way to install Metanorma on any OS.
This uses a Docker container, wrapping the Ruby gem
and all dependencies such as Node, Puppeteer, and PlantUML.

[TIP]
====
If you would rather avoid using the Docker distribution, for performance reasons or otherwise,
refer to a link:/author/topics/install/[complete installation guide] that covers
different ways of getting Metanorma up and running.
====

Steps:

. Install Docker. Get the latest version for your operating system at https://docker.com/.

. Pull the container:
+
[source,console]
--
docker pull ribose/metanorma
--

Now you should be able to run Metanorma executable like this:

[source,console]
--
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma/ -w /metanorma ribose/metanorma metanorma -t {Metanorma flavor} -x {output formats} {my document filename}
--

[NOTE]
====
To speed up document generation when using Metanorma in Docker,
it is recommended to specify `local-cache-only` document attribute.

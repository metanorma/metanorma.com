== Markup

=== Unnumbered clauses and annexes

Clauses and annexes may be marked as `[%unnumbered]`, in which case they do not receive section numbering, and are cross-referenced by their title.


=== List items and numbering

Unlike the Metanorma default, ordered lists do not have a fixed sequence of numbering styles: the type set for each ordered list (including nested lists) is respected. The default numbering style for ordered lists is always arabic.
The numbering of lists per level are in the order of "`1.`", "`a)`", and the Metanorma defaults.


=== Numerals

Numerals are automatically formatted as required by BIPM:

* French: the decimal symbol is the comma, numbers spaced in groups of three
* English: the decimal symbol is the period, numbers spaced in groups of three

EXAMPLE: `\stem:[1234567890]` is rendered as _1 234 567 890_ for both languages.

EXAMPLE: `\stem:[32123.456789]` is rendered as _32 123,456 789_ in French, and _32 123.456 789_ in English.


=== Cross-references

Cross-references formatted as `\<<{{anchor}},pagenumber%>>` are rendered in PDF as just the page number;
they are used for tables of content. In HTML output, they are treated as normal cross-references.

Cross-references to clauses are rendered in lowercase: "`see section 4.1`". Metanorma will attempt to impose correct capitalisation for instances at the start of blocks and sentences, but it may get it wrong.

To override such capitalisation, you can use the the flags `capital%` or `lowercase%` as the content of the cross-reference, to force that casing on the cross-reference.

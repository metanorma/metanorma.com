This documentation describes how to write a document for the Internet Draft and RFC
series using the AsciiDoc markup language and the Metanorma toolchain.

is also available at IETF Datatracker, with source
https://github.com/metanorma/rfc-asciidoc-rfc[on GitHub].

NOTE: RFC is supported in two kinds, v2 and v3. You will see notes in this documentation
which clarify which part applies to which kind of RFC.

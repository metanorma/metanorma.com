= Metanorma Asciidoc markup

This document documents the version of Metanorma Asciidoc aligned with
v3 RFC XML [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ietf/releases/tag/v2.0.0].
This version of Asciidoc is much closer aligned to the rest of Metanorma than the
version used in previous versions; this has the added benefit that the same Asciidoc
source can be used to generate output for both IETF and other Standards bodies,
which was not previously possible. 

The version of Asciidoc that supported v2 RFC XML
in previous versions is link:markup-v2.adoc[documented separately]. 
link:markup-v2tov3.adoc[A comparison of the two markups] is also provided, and can be
used to convert documents marked up for v2 RFC XML to documents for v3 RFC XML.

== Sections

[[abstract]]
=== Abstract

Any paragraphs following the document header are treated as the abstract
(`front/abstract`), whether they are notated as an Asciidoc preamble or as an
Asciidoc abstract; if both are present, the abstract takes priority. The abstract is
terminated by either the first section header (which ends the document
preamble), or a note.

Any notes immediately following the abstract are treated as RFC notes (`front/note`).

== Blocks

=== Examples

RFC XML does not recognize examples as a distinct element. The example label and
example contents are rendered without a containing element; the example label
appears on a paragraph of its own.

The example label (if any) is prefixed with the standard Metanorma prefix, "EXAMPLE: ",
or "EXAMPLE nnn: " if there are more than one examples in the clause.

=== Figures

Figures are rendered as RFC XML `figure`, and are treated as wrappers for
ASCII art, sourecode and images; they are redundant for v3 RFC XML, since
the processing of those blocks already inserts the `figure` wrapper.
Any text in an example block that precedes or follows sourcecode, an image, or preformatted text
is moved outside the figure.

=== Requirements, Recommendations, Permissions

RFC XML does not recognize recommendations as a distinct element. The recommendation label and
example contents are rendered without a containing element; the recommendation label
appears on a paragraph of its own. Recommendation components that are not meant
to be human readable (those set to `exclude` attribute) are left out of RFC XML.



=== Source code listings

In RFC XML, `sourcecode` elements only occur within a
`figure` wrapper; Metanorma-IETF supplies that wrapper if it is not provided
explicitly.

Any label supplied for sourcecode will be rendered before the `figure` wrapper.

Metanorma pseudocode is marked up in RFC as sourcecode; any formatting is
removed from the pseudocode body.

<8> `figure/sourcecode`


=== ASCII Art and Images

In RFC XML, `artwork` elements only occur within a
`figure` wrapper; Metanorma-IETF supplies that wrapper if it is not provided
explicitly.

All ASCII art is assigned the type "ascii-art".
Only SVG images are supported in `xml2rfc`; metanorma will issue a warning for any other image type.

Metanorma supports inline images; RFC XML does not. Any instances of inline
images in a paragraph are replaced by a placeholder counter ("[IMAGE nnn]");
the images are moved after the paragraph.

<10> `figure/artwork/@src`, `figure/artwork/@alt`

=== Formulae

Formulae are rendered consistent with the rest of Metanorma, as paragraphs of mathematical
expressions followed by a counter in parentheses; the counter is separated from the expression
by four spaces.

=== Mathematical expressions

In order for mathematical formatting to be recognised in Asciidoc, 
the document attribute `:stem:` needs to be set.

Unlike previous versions of this gem, 
mathematical expressions, whether in formulae or inline, are rendered as
AsciiMath delimited by `$$`; if a sequence of `$` already occurs in the text,
that delimiter has more `$` added to it until it is unique.

<7> `ol/li`

=== Definition Lists

A:: B <3>
--
<1> `dl/@anchor` 
<2> `dl/@newline`, `dl/@spacing`, `dl/@indent`
<3> `dl/dt`, `dl/dd`

metanorma-ietf permits anchors on definition list terms and definition list definitions,
whereas other flavours treat them as bookmarks (which are otherwise ignored in metanorma-ietf):

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id1]] A:: [[id2]]B
--

=== Note

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
NOTE
====
Sidebar <2>
====

[[id]] <1>
NOTE: Sidebar <2>
--
<1> `aside/@anchor`
<2> `<aside>Sidebar</aside>`

Notes are prefixed with the standard Metanorma prefix, "NOTE: ".

Exceptionally, notes after abstracts are encoded in v3 RFC XML as `note` (<<abstract>>).

=== Admonitions

Admonitions are rendered like notes as XML RFC `aside`, with the admonition label and title
as an initial paragraph:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
[CAUTION] <2>
.Here be dragons </2>
====
Sidebar <3>
====

[[id]] <1>
NOTE: Sidebar <2>
--
<1> `aside/@anchor`
<2> `aside/t
<3> `<aside>Sidebar</aside>`


=== Tables

The converter respects the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes of cells,
as set in Asciidoc (`3|`, .3|`).

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
.Table Title <2>
|===
|[[id]] head | head <3>

h|header cell | body cell <4>
| | [[id]] body cell <5>

|foot | foot <6>

--
<1> `table/@anchor`
<2> `table/name`
<3> `table/thead/tr/td`
<4> `table/tbody/tr/th`, `table/tbody/tr/td`
<5> `table/tbody/tr/td/@anchor` 
<6> `table/tfoot/tr/td`

NOTE: v3 RFC XML permits table cells to contain block elements, such as paragraphs and lists. 
This is done in AsciiDoc by prefixing the table cell with `a|`.

=== Paragraphs

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
[keepWithNext=true,keepWithPrevious=true] <2>
Paragraph text <3>
--
<1> `t/@anchor`
<2> `t/@keepWithNext`, `t/@keepWithPrevious` 
<3> `<t>Paragraph text</t>`

=== Quotes 

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
[quote, attribution, citation info] <2>
Quotation <3>
--
<1> `blockquote/@anchor`
<2> `blockquote/@quotedFrom`, `blockquote/@cite`. In v3 RFC XML, `citation info` is limited to a URL, and is not otherwise populated.
<3> `<blockquote>Quotation</blockquote>`


=== Comments

Unlike previous versions of this gem working with v3 RFC XML, this version
of the gem does not currently provide a means of populating XML comments
in RFC XML.

==== Editorial Notes

RFC XML provides for editorial comments which may optionally appear
in the published text (subject to either the `cref/@display`
attribute, or the `comments` processing instruction). As with the rest
of Metanorma, such editorial comments will only be included in the Metanorma
XML output, let alone the RFC XML output, if the Asciidoctor `:draft:`
document attribute is present. Unlike in v2 RFC XML,
editorial notes are marked up as Asciidoc sidebars.

[source,asciidoc]

=== Inline markup

=== Indexing

[source,asciidoc]
--
This ((<indexterm>)) <1>
is visible in the text,
this one is not (((indexterm, index-subterm))). <2>
--
<1> `<iref item="indexterm">indexterm</iref>`
<2> `<iref item="indexterm" subitem="index-subterm"/>`


=== Inline formatting

[source,asciidoc]
--
Linebreak: + <1>
_Italic_ <2>
*Bold* <3>
`Monospace` <4>
~subscript~ <5>
^superscript^ <6>
[bcp14]#MUST NOT# <7>
*MUST NOT* <8>
--
<1> Ignored, as documented in Levkowetz' implementation notes
<2> `<em>Italic</em>`
<3> `<strong>Bold</strong>`
<4> `<tt>Monospace</tt>`
<5> `<sub>subscript</sub>`
<6> `<sup>superscript</sup>`
<7> `<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>`
<8> if document flag `:no-rfc-bold-bcp14:` is present, then `<strong>MUST NOT</strong>`, else (by default) any BCP14/RFC2119 phrase in boldface and capitals is assumed to be intended to be tagged in `<bcp14>`.

NOTE: The delimiters must occur within the one line; the following is invalid in Metanorma AsciiDoc:
[source,asciidoc]
--
*WOULD
PROBABLY*
--

=== Cross-References

[source,asciidoc]
----
Content content content
<<crossreference>> <1>
<<crossreference,text>> <2>
<<crossreference,format=(counter|title|none|default): text>> <3>
http://example.com/[linktext] <4>
----
<1> `<xref target="crossreference"/>`
<2> `<xref target="crossreference">text</xref>`
<3> `<xref format="counter|title|none|default" target="crossreference">text</xref>`
<4> `<eref href="http://example.com/">linktext</eref>`

Note that fragments (e.g. `crossreference#fragment`) are not supported on the `xref/@target` attribute:
the RFC XML specification requires that the `xref/@target` attribute equals
the value of an anchor attribute elsewhere in the document.

If cross-reference text is not supplied, it is populated with
the Metanorma default, naming and numbering the referenced object.

=== Citations

<<crossreference,(of|comma|parens|bare)>> <1>
<<crossreference,(of|comma|parens|bare),section=4.3>> <2>
<<crossreference,(of|comma|parens|bare),section-4.3: text>> <3>
<<crossreference#fragment,section_number (of|comma|parens|bare)>> <4>
<<crossreference#fragment,section_number (of|comma|parens|bare): text>> <5>
----
<1> `<relref displayFormat="of|comma|parens|bare" target="crossreference"/>` 
<2> `<relref displayFormat="of|comma|parens|bare" section="section_number" target="crossreference"/>` 
<3> `<relref displayFormat="of|comma|parens|bare" section="section_number" target="crossreference">text</relref>` 
<4> `<relref relative="fragment" displayFormat="of|comma|parens|bare" section="section_number" target="crossreference"/>` 
<5> `<relref relative="fragment" displayFormat="of|comma|parens|bare" section="section_number" target="crossreference">text</relref>` 

Localities other than "clause" and "section" are ignored in the generated v3 RFC XML.

=== Footnotes

Footnotes in text are rendered as a separate "Endnotes" appendix,
with each endnote rendered as a paragraph prefixed by an incrementing numeric counter in brackets.
The footnote reference in the main text is replaced by the same counter in brackets.

Footnotes in tables and figures, similar to the rest of Metanorma, are rendered as `aside`
elements, with an incrementing alphabetic counter in brackets.

title: What is Metanorma?
---

Metanorma is actually not one thing, but three:

. The Metanorma toolchain: This is the software that you use to create documents and generate output. 
. Document metamodels: Metanorma provides a document structure for standardization documents, specified in https://www.isotc154.org/projects/iso-36001/[ISO 36001]. Since each organization has different requirements for their standard documents, they use a https://www.metanorma.org/flavors/[“flavor”] of Metanorma. A flavor is document model that reflects the SDO’s needs by providing additional metadata. 
. XML schemas: To use the defined document metamodels, there needs to be a machine-readable file so that documents can be checked against their intended structure. 
 
Metanorma has many advantages when you want to edit standards:

* Metanorma already supports the needs of many standardization committees, such as ISO, IETF, and many more.
* It uses the “What you see is what you mean” approach based on AsciiDoc.
* You can style your content differently, depending on the output.
* The document models ensure complete and consistent standard documents that follow the rules of your organization.

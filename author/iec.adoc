with Metanorma-IEC:

* International Standard (https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/[ISO/IEC DIR 1:2019 + IEC SUP:2019, Clause 2])

* Technical Report (https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/[ISO/IEC DIR 1:2019 + IEC SUP:2019, 3.3])
* Publicly Available Specification (https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/[ISO/IEC DIR 1:2019 + IEC SUP:2019, 3.2])

The syntax of ISO and IEC documents is identical, as defined in
ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2018
(https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir2%7Bed8.0.RLV%7Den.pdf[IEC version (PDF link)],
https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO version (HTML link)]);

== Document attributes

=== Parts and subparts

`:partnumber:`:: `{part}` or `{part}-{subpart}`

IEC documents can have both parts and subparts, unlike ISO documents
which only supports parts.

Both `{part}` and `{subpart}` only accept numerals.


=== Document type

`:doctype:`:: type of document.

The permitted types are:

* `international-standard`
* `technical-specification`
* `technical-report`,
* `publicly-available-specification`
* `guide`
* `interpretation-sheet`.

Unlike ISO, IEC does not have `international-workshop-agreement`,
and does have `interpretation-sheet`.

=== Project stage and substage of document

==== General

The project stage and substage can be entered in two ways shown below.

Not all IEC codes are represented -- those that are not are set by the IEC-CO (IEC Central Office)
rather than authors, or do not correspond to standards documents but to other
parts of the process (compilation of comments, reports on votes, translation, etc.),
are not represented here.

The following codes are ignored:

* PCC, PRVC, PRVDISH, PRVD, PRVDPAS, PRVDTR, PRVDTS, PRVN
* preDISH, prePNW, preCDPAS, preCD, preDTR
* DECDISH, DECFDIS, DECPUB
* TCDV, TDISH, TDTR, TDTS, TFDIS, TPUB
* RPUB
* DEL
* MERGED, DREJ
* ADISSB, APUBSB


==== Via ISO International Harmonized Stage Codes

`:docstage:`:: project stage code of document
`:docsubstage:`:: project substage code of document

The codes in the first entry form are drawn from the
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[ISO International Harmonized Stage Codes].

The mapping to IEC stage codes is taken from
https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir1-consolidatediecsup%7Bed15.0.RLV%7Den.pdf[ISO/IEC DIR 1:2019 + IEC SUP:2019, Annex SH],
updated against the current discussion of stage codes in
https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/processes/stage_codes.htm[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Stage Codes] and
https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/processes/workflows.htm[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Workflow].


The following codes are supported:

==== Via project stage abbreviation

`:stage`:: project stage abbreviation

An IEC project stage abbreviation code entered under `:stage:` will be recognised,
and broken down into the corresponding ISO harmonized stage and substage codes
shown in the table automatically.

For example, `:stage: ACD` is equivalent to setting `:docstage: 20` and `:docsubstage: 99`.

In the case of A2CD... A9CD and 2CD... 9CD, the numeral value of the `:iteration:` attribute
will also be set accordingly.

For example, `:stage: 8CD` is equivalent to setting `:docstage: 35`, `:docsubstage: 20` and `:iteration: 8`.

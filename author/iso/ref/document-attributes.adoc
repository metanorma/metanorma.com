= Metanorma ISO document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib]]
[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma’s processing of ISO documents.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author’s documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just ISO.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

== Document info

`:tc-docnumber:`:: The document number assigned by the Technical committee

`:partnumber:`:: The ISO document part number. This can be "`part-subpart`" if this is an ISO/IEC or IEC document.

`:doctype:`:: Has its possible values defined by
https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html[ISO deliverables: The different types of ISO publications]
(mandatory). The permitted types are:
`international-standard`, `technical-specification`, `technical-report`,
`publicly-available-specification`, `international-workshop-agreement`, `guide`.

`:docstage:`:: The stage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes]).
Synonym of `:status:`.

NOTE: ISO authors usually create Metanorma documents at stages `00` through `40`
(PWI, NWIP, WD, CD, DIS).
Documents at the final stages, `50` and `60` (FDIS, PRF, IS), are created by
ISO Editorial Program Managers at ISO/CS (aka ISO EPMs, ISO Editors).
Authors using Metanorma are not expected to edit documents at those stages, and
are not necessary in a normal submission process.
These stages, however, can be used for mirroring and tracking of final stage
and published standards, which many authors do.
--

`:docsubstage:`:: The substage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes]).
If this is left out, a substage of "`00`" is assumed, with the exception of
stage "`60`" (published), where a substage of "`60`" is assumed.
("`60.00`" is the final proof, "`60.60`" the published document.)

=== Title


`:title-intro-en:`:: The introductory component of the English title of the
document. This and the other `:title-*` document attributes are used instead
of the `metanorma-standoc` `:title:` attribute and the default AsciiDoc title
(the first line of the document header, prefixed with `=`).

`:title-main-en:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory).

`:title-part-en:`:: The English title of the document part

`:title-intro-fr:`:: The introductory component of the French title of the
document. (This document template presupposes authoring in English; a different
template will be needed for French, including French titles of document
components such as annexes.)

`:title-main-fr:`:: The main component of the French title of the document
(mandatory).

`:title-part-fr:`:: The French title of the document part

== Author info

the same applies for all `technical-committee`, `subcommittee` and `workgroup` attributes)

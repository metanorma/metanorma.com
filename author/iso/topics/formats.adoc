= Metanorma-ISO formats

In addition to the normal output formats of Metanorma (`html, doc, pdf`), the ISO flavour of metanorma
also supports the following output formats:

`html_alt`:: HTML output with a more Web-like rendering (whereas `html` abides by ISO document style as much as possible)
`sts`:: NISO STS
`isosts`:: ISO STS [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.5.6]

= Reviewer notes

To annotate document with reviewer notes (essentially, arbitrary blocks of text),
Metanorma uses AsciiDoc sidebar notation.

Sidebars can be separated at a distance from the text they are annotating;
the text they are annotating is indicated through anchors. 

[NOTE]
====
Reviewer notes are only rendered
if `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#draft[:draft:]` attribute has been specified
for the document(s).
====

The following attributes on reviewer notes are mandatory:

* `reviewer` attribute (naming the reviewer) 
* the starting target anchor of the note (`from` attribute)

The following attributes are optional:

* `date` attribute, optionally including the time (as xs:date or xs:datetime)
* the ending target anchor of the note (`to` attribute)

The span of text covered by the reviewer note is from the start of the
text encompassed by the `from` element, to the end of the text encompassed
by the `to` element. If only the `from` element supplied, the reviewer note
covers the `from` element. The `from` and `to` elements can be bookmarks,
which cover no space.

== TODO expressions

A commonplace convention in software source code, as well as lightly marked up text,
is to prefix comments indicating pending actions with `TODO`.
Metanorma treats `TODO` as an admonition label, and converts it into a reviewer note.

The `from`, `to` `reviewer` and `date` attributes are all treated as optional.

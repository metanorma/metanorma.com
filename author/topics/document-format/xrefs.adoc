== Index terms

=== General

Metanorma supports index entries with primary, secondary and tertiary
index terms. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

Primary index terms are listed under the first-level index,
the secondary index terms are listed under the primary index terms' sub-index,
and the tertiary index terms are listed under the secondary index term's sub-index.

In PDF, indexes are rendered as references to page numbers. In HTML and DOC, indexes are rendered
as references to the nearest labelled block; a note, example, figure, formula etc., if the index term
is contained within it, or a clause or subclause, otherwise.

Index term links are only rendered in certain flavours, and do not
appear otherwise in DOC, PDF or HTML output.

NOTE: Currently, only Metanorma IETF XML RFC and Metanorma BIPM outputs render index terms.


=== Rendered index term syntax

Metanorma index entries are entered through two different
syntaxes. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

Rendered index term: `+((Term))+`

* Produces the output "`Term`"; and
* Links to the primary index term of the same name, "`Term`".

Hidden index term: `+(((IndexTerm1)))+`,
  `+(((IndexTerm1, IndexTerm2)))+` or
  `+(((IndexTerm1, IndexTerm2, IndexTerm3)))+`

* Produces no output; and
* Links to the primary index term `IndexTerm1`. And if provided, links to
  the secondary nesting, `IndexTerm2` and the tertiary nesting `IndexTerm3`.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)),
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))).
--


=== Rich-text formatting

Rich-text formatting in index terms is
supported [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

[source,asciidoc]
--
signifying by divine providence that I, ((*Arthur*)),
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword~E~, stem:[sqrt(E)], Excalibur))).
--

NOTE: Formatting of index terms is ignored in IETF rendering.


=== Entry ranges

Metanorma supports index entries that involve ranges [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0],
using the command `index-range:to[...]`.

The command itself accepts an AsciiDoc index entry, such as
`+((...))+` or `+(((...)))+`.

The index entry range starts at the location of the `index-range`
command, in the same way as the index command it contains; the end of
the range is the element with the anchor `to`, and that is expected
to be provided as a bookmark.

[source,asciidoc]
--
signifying by divine providence that I, index-range:end-range-1[((*Arthur*))],
was to carry Excalibur index-range:end-range-2[(((Sword~A~, stem:[sqrt(2)], Excalibur)))].

...

and so forth.[[end-range-1]]

...

_Sic explicit fabula._[[end-range-2]]
--

The preceding example has a visible index entry for _**Arthur**_,
ranging from the location of `+*Arthur*+` up to `end-range-1`, and
a hidden index entry for _Sword~A~_, ranging from the location of
`+Sword~A~+` up to `end-range-2`.


=== Cross-references

Metanorma also supports "`see`" and "`see also`" cross-references between
index terms [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.5],
using the `index` command.

The command takes at least two parameters:

* the primary index term to be cross-referenced;
* the target of the cross-reference;
* optionally, the secondary and tertiary index term to be cross-referenced.

[source,asciidoc]
--
index:see[Satchmo,Louis Armstrong]
index:see[James Brown,influences,Hank Ballard and the Midnighters]
index:also[guitar,electric,technique,Jimi Hendrix]
--

Rendered as:

____
* Satchmo, _see_ Louis Armstrong
* James Brown
** influences, _see_ Hank Ballard and the Midnighters
* guitar
** electric
*** technique, _see also_ Jimi Hendrix
____


[[text-cross-refs]]
== Cross-references

=== General

Cross-references are realized in Metanorma AsciiDoc by assigning an anchor
to the block to be referenced, and writing a cross-reference containing
that anchor ID:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[anchor-id]]
== Target clause

The requirements are...

== Reference clause

As seen in <<anchor-id>>...
--

WARNING: See <<text-ref-allowed-anchors>> for allowed characters in anchor IDs.

NOTE: Cross-reference text in Metanorma adheres to guidance given in
ISO/IEC DIR 2 for internal cross-references, in order to guarantee
unambiguous referencing.

In particular, if a formula, example, figure, list, list item or table is cross-referenced
outside its (sub)clause, the clause containing the item is always given in the cross-reference,
unless the item is being referenced in the same clause.

In the case of notes, the containing clause is extended to containing example, figure or table.

[example]
====
For example, in the Metanorma ISO Rice model sample document
formula B.1 is defined in Annex B.6, and is referenced in B.6 and B.7.

In the Rice model document published by ISO, both instances are cited as "`Formula (B.1)`".
However, Metanorma follows ISO/IEC DIR 2 in citing the former
as "`Formula (B.1)`", but the latter as "`B.6, Formula (B.1)`".

In this sense, Metanorma is "`more royalist than the king`" in applying formatting rules and
validationâ€”which is what you would want of a computer-based tool.
====

The label of the item cross-referenced, the use of brackets, and the containing reference
are all taken care of by Metanorma; the document author needs only give the item identifier
in the AsciiDoc source
(e.g. `\<<``formulaB-1``>>` generates either "`Formula (B.1)`" or "`B.6, Formula (B.1)`",
depending on where in the document it occurs.)

If the cross-reference is given with `droploc%` as its text, then the label and prefix
are dropped: the cross-reference value is given in
isolation [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.4].

This can be done for example for ranges:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Clauses <<context,droploc%>> to <<improvement,droploc%>>
----

to be rendered as e.g.

____
Clauses 7 to 9
____


[[text-ref-allowed-anchors]]
=== Anchor ID syntax

Anchor IDs of any type (cross-references, items, bibliographies, etc.) are directly
converted into XML, and therefore *must not* contain the following:

* colons
* whitespaces or;
* words starting with numbers.

These cases are not supported in XML; permitted characters are specified by the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#NT-NCName[NCName attribute for Namesapece Declaration].

Colons in cross-references are used for
link:/author/topics/document-format/collections#indirect-xrefs[indirect cross-references between files in the same collection],
to delimit namespaces and containers from anchor IDs [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.4].

=== Localities

Normally in AsciiDoc, any text in a cross-reference that follows a comma
constitutes custom text for the cross-reference.

So a cross-reference `\<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>`
would be rendered as "`the foregoing reference`", and hyperlinked to the `ISO7301` reference.

In Metanorma AsciiDoc cross-references, bibliographic localities
(e.g. page numbers, clause numbers) can be added directly after the comma,
as part of the cross-reference text.

NOTE: This differs from the normal AsciiDoc treatment of custom text.

[example]
====
EXAMPLE: "`ISO 7301, Clause 2, Table 1a, pp. 7-9`" would be expressed as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=2,table=1a,page=7-9>>
--
====

See link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography#localities[localities and locality values].

=== List items

List items can be cross-referenced by inserting a bookmark at the very start of the list item:

[source,asciidoc]
--
. Ordered list
.. [[id1]] This is the first list item
... [[id2]] This is a list sub-item
--

=== Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks to URIs can have alt text, which is used in accessibility (corresponding to the HTML
`a@title` attribute). This is specified by appending `,title=...` after the text in the
URL macro in AsciiDoc:

[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
http://www.example.com[text to go into the hyperlink]

http://www.example2.com[text to go into the second hyperlink,title=This is a tooltip for the link]
--
====

=== Cross-references to external documents

In link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography#localities[localities and locality values],
anchor can be integrated in citations of documents via references; for example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<ISO7301,anchor=xyz>>
--

will generate a hyperlink to the element with ID `xyz` in document `ISO7301`. This convention
is necessary for cross-references between documents in a Metanorma document collection.

Outside of that, Metanorma will process cross-references to anchors within
external documents just like typical AsciiDoc.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<document1.adoc#b>>
--

will be processed as a link to anchor `#b` in document `document1.adoc`.

If the reference uses the `.adoc` suffix, as in the example above, it is stripped in Metanorma XML
and substituted with the extension of the current document type during document generation.

The above example is rendered in Metanorma XML as `<xref target="document1#b">`,
in HTML as `<a href="document1.html#b">`, and in PDF as `<a href="document1.pdf#b">`.

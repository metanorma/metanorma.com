= Terms

== Defining Terms: the "`Terms and definitions`" section

=== Grammar summary

"`Terms and definitions`" sections follow a strict grammar
reflected in their Metanorma AsciiDoc markup:

* The term is given as a *subheading* at the appropriate level
  (three equal signs, unless there are subsections in the Terms and Definition section).
  The term may be cross-referenced from other terms, in which case it should have an *anchor*.

* The term is optionally followed by *alternative/admitted terms*,
  which must be marked up in an `+alt:[...]+` macro;
  *deprecated terms*, which must be marked up in a `+deprecated:[...]+` macro;
  and a term *domain*, which must be marked up in a `+domain:[...]+` macro.

* The *definition* of the term is given in a separate paragraph.

* The definition is optionally followed by *examples*
  (paragraphs with an `[example]` style attribute).

* The definition is then optionally followed by *notes* (denoted with a `NOTE:` prefix).

* The definition is then followed by a *citation* for the term
  (marked with a `[.source]` role attribute).

* The citation is a cross-reference to a normative reference,
  optionally followed by a comma and a modification if applicable.
  If the comma is used on its own, then the term will be shown as modified,
  with no specific modification.

EXAMPLE:

[source,adoc]
----
=== instant

point on the term:[time axis]

NOTE: An instantaneous event occurs at a specific instant.

[.source]
<<IEV,clause "113-01-08">>
----

renders as

.Example of a single term.
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-instant.png[]

NOTE: An unmodified term and definition does not require any text after
the source reference.

More complex concepts can also be specified, with alternative terms,
deprecated terms, domain, examples and a definition modified
from its original source.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[paddy]]
=== paddy
alt:[paddy rice]
alt:[rough rice]
deprecated:[cargo rice]
domain:[rice]

rice retaining its husk after threshing

[example]
Foreign seeds, husks, bran, sand, dust.

NOTE: The starch of waxy rice consists almost entirely of amylopectin.
The kernels have a tendency to stick together after cooking.

[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>, The term "cargo rice" is shown as deprecated,
and Note 1 to entry is not included here.
--

renders as

.Example of a single term with elaborated specifications
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-paddy.png[]

A trailing comma after the source reference can indicate that the
term or definition was "`modified`", but with no further detail:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,
--

renders as

.Example of a single source tagged as "`modified`".
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-single-source.png[]

A term and definition can be sourced from multiple sources (in accordance with ISO 10241-1).
In this case each source should be entered in a separate `[.source]` paragraph.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,

[.source]
<<ISO7302,section 3.10>,
--


The requirement that the source of a term be given in a citation also applies when the source
is a termbase,
such as the http://www.electropedia.org[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)].
Formally, IEV references should be cited as `IEC 60050-nnn:20xx`,
where `n` is the top-level clause, and `20xx` is the year when that particular specification
was published.

EXAMPLE: "`IEC 60050-113:2011, 113-01-07`".


[NOTE]
====
.Empty section

If there are no terms and definitions defined in this standards document,
no terms should be included in the section body (it should be blank).
The boilerplate at the start of the section is adjusted to reflect both possibilities;
any paragraphs or lists in the AsciiDoc input (which can replicate the expected boilerplate)
is stripped in the intermediate XML format.
====


=== Grouping IEV references

For convenience, Metanorma requires all IEV references to be to a single reference,
named `IEV` in the normative references. During the rendering of Metanorma AsciiDoc into Metanorma XML,
this reference will be replaced by the various required "`IEC 60050-nnn:20xx`" references.
(That means that you should not insert your own instances of IEC 60050 references
for IEV citations: they will be duplicated by the automatically generated references.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>

...

[bibliography]
* [[[ievtermbank,IEV]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
// will be excluded from HTML and Word output. Will be replaced by a canonical reference in XML output.
--

Note that, for IEV entries to be validated, the IEV reference must be given as a Clause,
and in quotes (otherwise the locality syntax would be interpreted as a range);
so `\<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>` for IEV 103-01-02.

=== Title

A Terms and Definitions clause will be recognized if either _Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms_
or _Terms and definitions_ is given as the title,
regardless of case.


=== Source

If the Terms and Definitions of a standard are partly or fully sourced from
another standard, that standard is cited in a “source” attribute to the section:
e.g., `source=STANDARD_IDENTIFIER`, where standard identifier
is the reference anchor of the cited standard as given under the Normative
References.
(The attribute needs to be applied to the top-level clause, if there are subclauses.)

Any boilerplate of the Terms and Definitions section is adjusted accordingly.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[source=ISO712]
== Terms and Definitions
--

renders as

.Illustration of boilerplate of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with a single source ("`ISO 712`").
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-boilerplate-single-source.png[]

Multiple sources are allowed, and need to be quoted and comma-delimited:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[source="ISO712,ISO24333"]
== Terms and Definitions
--

which renders as

.Illustration of boilerplate of the Terms and Definitions section adjusted with two sources ("`ISO 712 and ISO 24333:2009`").
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-boilerplate-multiple-sources.png[]

=== Markup within term macros

The macros `+alt:[...]+`, `+deprecated:[...]+` and `+domain:[...]+`
can contain their own markup.

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== paddy
alt:[_paddy_ rice]
deprecated:[[smallcap]#cargo# rice]
domain:[rice]

term:[rice] from which the husk only has been removed
--

==== Stem expressions

AsciiDoc does not permit macros to be nested inside other macros.

Therefore the following markup which introduces a stem expression
as an admitted term, is considered illegal.

NOTE: The use of stem expressions as preferred terms is not a problem,
because the macro appears as a header.

[source,asciidoc]
.Bad example
--
=== stem:[t_90]
alt:[stem:[t_A]]

Time to launch.
--

However, Metanorma will treat any standalone paragraph in a term section,
consisting of just a stem macro, as an admitted term:

[source,asciidoc]
.Good example
--
=== stem:[t_90]

stem:[t_A]

Time to launch.
--

.Illustration of a term that uses stem expressions.

=== Subclauses

Any clause within a "`Terms & Definitions`" section which is a non-terminal subclause (has
child nodes) is automatically considered a terms (or definitions) section. On the other hand,
any descendant of a `nonterm` clause is also a `nonterm` clause.

Informative clauses are indicated with the attribute `[obligation=informative]`;
clauses are normative by default.

==== Introductory non-term section

All terminal subclauses of a term section (i.e. clauses that have no subclauses
of their own) are treated as term definitions.

Exceptionally, an introductory section can be treated as a subclause instead of a term,
by prefixing it with the style attribute `[.nonterm]`:

[source,asciidoc]

== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Terms defined in ISO 10303-1

For the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, the following terms
defined in ISO 10303-1 apply:

* integrated resource

[.nonterm]
=== Terms defined in ISO 10303-11

For the purposes of this document, the following terms defined in
ISO 10303-11 apply.

* entity;
* entity data type;
--

.Inclusion of non-term subclauses using the `[.nonterm]` attribute
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-non-clause-section.png[]

The `[.nonterm]` attribute must only be used in subclauses that do
not contain any terms underneath (like the example above).
Otherwise, these terms will not be processed following the
corresponding formatting rules.

[example]
======
EXAMPLE: If the `[.nonterm]` attribute is applied to a
term-containing subclause, the wrong rendering will occur:

[source,asciidoc]

== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Terms defined in ISO 10303-1

For the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, the following terms
defined in ISO 10303-1 apply:

==== actual function range

the function which are related to some tuple of inputs
--

== Citing terms

=== General

Instances of terms in the body of the document can be marked up to
indicate where the term is defined.
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.14].

This can be done whether the term is defined:

* in the current document;
* in a cited document; or
* in an external termbase.

Marking up term instances does not currently have any impact on how
they are rendered: this markup is intended for semantic processing of
standards documents.

The following syntax is used:

[source,adoc]
----
{{identifier,term}}

// if the display text differs from the cited term
{{identifier,term,text}}
----

The `{{identifier,term,text}}` markup is analogous to the markup of
cross-references in AsciiDoc, `\<<anchor,text>>`, and consists of:

* An identifier for the term being cited;
* The term cited;
* The text to be displayed, if it is distinct from the cited term.


=== Term defined within current document

If the term is defined within the current document, the term citation
gives the anchor of the term definition in the document, the canonical
term name, and optionally the text to be displayed.

The anchor is converted into a document cross-reference in Metanorma XML.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
{{local-anchor,term}}

// if the display text differs from the cited term
{{local-anchor,text,term}}
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[[immatk]]
=== immature kernel
alt:[unripe kernel]

kernel, whole or broken, which is unripe and/or underdeveloped

== Discussion
The source of the {{immatk,immature kernel}} has not yet been identified.
Allusions to {{immatk,unripe kernels,immature kernel}} are plentiful in
the literature.
--

=== Term defined in external document

If the term is defined in an external document, which has a
corresponding bibliographic anchor, the term citation gives the
bibliographic anchor of the term definition in that document, the
canonical term name, and optionally the text to be displayed.

In other words, the same arguments are used as for the internal
cross-reference, except that a bibliographic anchor substitutes the
internal anchor. The bibliographic anchor is converted into a citation
in the Metanorma XML.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
{{bibliographic-anchor,term}}

// if the display text differs from the cited term
{{bibliographic-anchor,text,term}}
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative References
* [[[iso17301,ISO 17301]]] Cereals and pulses -- Specifications and test methods -- Rice

== Discussion
The source of the {{iso17301,immature kernel}} has not yet been identified.
Allusions to {{iso17301,unripe kernels,immature kernel}} are plentiful in
the literature.
--

As with citation markup, the `bibliographic-anchor` element can be supplemented by
a comma-delimited list of
(link:bibliography#localities[localities and locality values]).

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Normative References
* [[[iso17301,ISO 17301]]] Cereals and pulses -- Specifications and test methods -- Rice

== Discussion
The source of the {{iso17301,clause=3.9,immature kernel}} has not yet been identified.
Allusions to {{iso17301,clause=3.9,unripe kernels,immature kernel}} are plentiful in
the literature.
--


=== Term defined in external termbase

If the term is defined in an external termbase, the term is identified
as the termbase identifier, then colon, then the identifier for the
term within the termbase.

Because colons are not permitted in cross-references or bibliographic
anchors, the presence of a colon identifies the first argument in a
term citation as identifying an external termbase term. The other two
arguments of the macro are as above, the canonical term name, and
optionally the text to be displayed. There is no expectation that the
termbase be included in the bibliography.

[source,adoc]
----
{{termbase-anchor,term}}

// if the display text differs from the cited term
{{termbase-anchor,text,term}}
----

The `termbase-anchor` is implementation-specific.
Currently, only the IEC's Electropedia (IEV) is supported, where the
reference syntax is `IEV:{IEV term ID}`.

[source,adoc]
----
{{IEV:IEV-term-ID,term}}

// if the display text differs from the cited term
{{IEV:IEV-term-ID,text,term}}
----

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Discussion
The source of the {{IEV:171-05-02,immature kernel}} has not yet been identified.
Allusions to {{IEV:171-05-02,unripe kernels,immature kernel}} are plentiful in
the literature.

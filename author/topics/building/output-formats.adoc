= Output formats

The Metanorma suite compiles documents in the following formats.

== Metanorma XML

The Metanorma XML output is the intermediate format which marks up the semantic content of the standards document, and is
used to drive the other formats. The Metanorma XML file is also the file which is used during
the link:/docs/authoring/validation[validation stage].

== HTML

The HTML output is in HTML 5. It has optional Data-URI encoding of local images; if images in the output are are not Data-URI encoded,
they are moved to a folder called `{filename}_images`, and renamed with GUID names, to prevent collisions. Audio and video files are
not supported. All HTML output has a sidebar with a Javascript-generated Table of Contents, which is two section levels deep.

== PDF

PDF output, for those standards gems that support it, is generated from the HTML output via Google Puppeteer (which runs in Node.js).
The PDF output generation takes advantage of the print mode in the HTML CSS stylesheet, so much of the browser-like styling of the HTML
is rendered as a more print-like document. Because it is generated from HTML, the PDF output does not support page numbers in its
Table of Contents. Nor does it support advanced paragraph formatting, such as Keep With Next or Widow/Orphan control.

== Microsoft Word

The Word output is output as legacy DOC format (used in pre-2007 version of MS Word) rather than DOCX, and it is generated using the
Microsoft Office flavor of HTML 4, as a Multipart HTML Word Document (MHT,
the MIME-encoded counterpart to the HTML obtained when you save a Word document as HTML).

=== Limitations of .doc format

Using .doc imposes some constraints:

* SVG images are not supported. (Word internally converts them into PNG files to render them in Word HTML.)
* .doc files cannot be processed by Apple Pages or LibreOffice, only by Microsoft Word.

[TIP]
====
To open the Word output in LibreOffice in particular, you will need to convert .doc file to .docx file
in a specific way:

. Open file with MS Word
. Save it once by changing filename extension to `.doc` (you can confirm file overwrite, when asked)
. "Save As" and choose `.docx` format this time
====

* When you open the document, the table of contents shows all pages as being 1. That is because the table of contents
needs to be updated from within Word: Right click the table of contents, and select "Update Field" and then "Update entire table".

=== Why not .docx

Using DOC HTML makes it much easier to generate documents with
the advanced formatting requirements of Metanorma (including complex tables, formulas, footnotes, headers and footers,
nested list numbering and cross-references) than generating either native DOCX (in OOXML), or the DOCX flavor of MHT.

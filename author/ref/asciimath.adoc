= Asciimath support

Metanorma uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Asciidoctor Asciimath parser]
to process Asciimath, converting it to MathML for Metanorma processing. For rendering in
HTML, the MathML generated is processed by https://www.mathjax.org[MathJax]. For rendering
in Word, the MathML is converted to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML[Office Open XML].

== Asciidoctor Asciimath

The version of Asciimath supported by the Asciidoctor Asciimath parser is slightly different 
to other variants of Asciimath. The following are differences between the version of Asciimath
documented on http://asciimath.org[asciimath.org]:

== Conversion to Word OOXML

AsciiMath and MathJax processors are tolerant of loose syntax in mathematical expressions.
Currently the conversion of MathML to OOXML is not as tolerant: if a mathematical operator
takes a single argument, the OOXML expects to find that argument brackets as a single entity.
If that does not happen, Word displays a dotted square where it would expect the single
argument to appear. To remedy this, you will need to bracket the argument of the operator
in invisible brackets (`{:`, `:}`).

For example, the following Asciimath displays correctly in HTML under MathJax:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem]
++++
bar X' = (1)/(v) sum_(i = 1)^v t_i
++++
--

However, it displays incorrectly in Word:

That is because the `sum` operator expects to find a single expression as its argument,
but `t_i` is processed as two tokens. To get this expression processed correctly for
Word, you will need to bracket `t_i`:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[stem]
++++
bar X' = (1)/(v) sum_(i = 1)^v {:t_i:}
++++

= Document attributes

This is the list of link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes[document attributes]
supported by most flavors of Metanorma.

[TIP]
====
If you’re using one of the link:/flavors/[officially supported flavors of Metanorma],
see also flavor-specific guidance for any additional supported or required headers.
====

== Build & validation

`:nodoc:`::
Instructs Metanorma to not generate Word and HTML output, means only XML output will be generated.

`:novalid:`::
Suppress document validation.

=== Reference lookup

For bibliographic lookup, see link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup[automatic reference lookup].

`:no-isobib:`::
If set, do not use the `relaton` or `iev` gem functionality to look up
ISO and IEV references online, nor the cache of `relaton` and `iev` searches.

=== Caches

For bibliographic caches, see link:/author/topics/building/reference-lookup/#lookup-result-caching[lookup result caching].

`:no-isobib-cache:`::
If set, use the `relaton` and `iev` gem functionality to look up
ISO and IEV references online, but do not use the cache of `relaton` and `iev` searches.

`:local-cache:`::
Use the local relaton and iev search caches to override the global `relaton` and `iev` search
caches. If a directory name is given for the attribute, that name overrides `relaton` as the
cache name.

`:local-cache-only:`::
Use the local relaton and iev search caches to the exclusion of the global
`relaton` and `iev` search caches.
If a directory name is given for the attribute, that name overrides `relaton` as the cache name.

`:flush-caches:`::
If set, delete and reinitialise the cache of `https://www.relaton.com/[relaton]` searches.

=== Math

[[stem]] `:stem:`::
This attribute is required if you have any AsciiMath, MathML, or LaTeX
included in the document; otherwise they will not be detected. If you want
the STEM expressions in your document to be interpreted as LaTeX by default,
use `:stem: latexmath`.

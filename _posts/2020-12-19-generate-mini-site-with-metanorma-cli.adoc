    Generate a document site for a set of documents using Metanorma CLI
---

A set of Metanorma documents can be compiled and published as a
document site.

It is not uncommon that multiple Metanorma documents are managed
within a single repository. These cases include:

* multiple documents belong to the same series;
* a single document published to multiple venues;
* multiple parts of a document collection.

The https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP[NIST Automated Cryptography Validation Protocol (ACVP) series]
is one such example.

In fact, the Metanorma sample document sites for every flavor
provides multiple sample documents arranged under a single site.

Previous to this announcement, there are a couple tools (and hoops)
to jump through to make this happen:

1. Use a build dependency tool such as `make` (our favorite)
  to manage shared dependencies
2. Use a static-site generator (SSG), such as Relaton or Jekyll
  to make the generated documents available in an HTML index.
3. Link these tools up with Metanorma and generate the document
  renders, the publishable site, and finally deploy the site.

Cumbersome to say the least!

Many Metanorma users have been using the "`unofficial`"
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-itu/blob/main/Makefile[Makefile]
that is being used in Metanorma sample document sites.
It typically works fine, except that over time it grew
and became hard to maintain.

I'm happy to announce that site generation functionality
is now available as part of the official CLI.

Let's go through a quick demo to see it in action, and then
try customizing the build.


== Demo setup

Let's use the https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-itu[Metanorma ITU sample repo]
as an example.

There are several files there, but to keep the demo short, we focus
on the following files and directories.

[source,sh]
----
mn-samples-itu              # Root directory
|
|-- sources                 # Source directory
|   |-- images              # Nested images for assets
|   |-- G.191.adoc          # Individual document inside sources
|   |-- G.650.1-201803.adoc # Another individual document
|   |-- ...
|
|-- metanorma.yml           # Configuration file in root directory
|...
----

There are two important components that relate to site generation:

. the `metanorma.yml` configuration file;
. the individual documents under the `sources/` directory

Under `sources` there are two Metanorma AsciiDoc files
(the "`source documents`") and an `images` folder for assets.


== Generate the site

To generate the site, all you need is to install the
latest version of the
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-cli/releases/latest[Metanorma CLI].

Then run the following:

[source, sh]
----
metanorma site generate ./sources
----

The `./sources` path indicates to Metanorma that the documents inside this
path should be compiled and built into a site.

Specifically, this is what Metanorma does:

* scan through `./sources` and discover any Metanorma document files;
* compile those documents;
* create `site/` and place within an `index.html` and the compiled document files, linked from the index.

Voila! You will have the `site/` created with HTML ready to deploy (or package!).

During the process, Metanorma will also print out the details in the terminal
to keep you updated.

This command is the very bare minimum to generate a site, but let's look at the help
command to see what's available.

Running `metanorma site help generate` shows the basics of the command:

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma site help generate

Usage:
  metanorma site generate SOURCE_PATH

Options:
  -c, [--config=CONFIG]          # The metanorma configuration file
  -o, [--output-dir=OUTPUT_DIR]  # Output directory for the generated site
                                 # Default: /home/[your-repo-path]/site
----

This covers most use cases, but what if we only want to include
specific files or add custom site metadata? The next section is for you.


== Specify output path

You can also specify the output path of the generated site.
By default, `metanorma site generate` places the generated site
under the directory `site/` (auto-created if it doesn't exist)
relative to the current working directory.

To specify the output path, you can use the `--output-dir={path}` (`-o {path}`)
option.

This command generates the site at `production/`.

[source, sh]
----
metanorma site generate ./sources -o production
----


== Customize site generation

You might have noticed the `--config={file}` (or just `-c {file}`) option
in the `site generate` help documentation. There is indeed an option
to customize the site build.

This option takes a YAML file and uses that as site generation instructions,

Currently it offers the following customizations:

* Build a site with specific source files
* Customize site metadata (e.g., site title, site copyright)


=== Build with specific source files

By default, `metanorma site generate` generates documents for the entire
folder. But let's say we only want to generate the site with a single
file: `sources/G.191.adoc`.

Here's how we do it through the Metanorma site configuration file:
(please pay attention to the node structure)

[source,yaml]
----
# filename: metanorma.yml

metanorma:
  source:
    files:
      - G.191.adoc
----

The Metanorma site configuration file uses the following structure:

* at the top level we have the key `metanorma` followed by the key `source` below
* under the key `source`, there is one more level of nesting with `files`

Under `files`, relative paths to documents (each entry is a path to a document;
relative to the directory of the config file) can be provided as an array
(each YAML array value is prefixed with a hyphen-space `- xxx.adoc`).

If you need to more flexibility, the wildcard "`asterisk`" (`*`) is also
supported for file paths.

By default, Metanorma will look for a config file named `metanorma.yml` in the
current directory.

This follow command will build the site with the file paths you specified in
`metanorma.yml`.

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate ./sources -o site-folder
----

In the case where you juggle multiple site configurations, or wish to name your
configuration file differently, you can specify a different path for
the configuration file, such as:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate ./sources --config production.yml
----


=== Customize site metadata (e.g. title, copyright)

The site generation functionality also allows the provision of a custom title
for the hero area or the name for the documents that form site, which is useful
to indicate ownership or copyright.

To do that we can use the same configuration file and add the following information.

[source,yaml]
----
# filename: metanorma.yml

metanorma:
  source:
    files:
      - G.191.adoc
      - ...
  collection:
    name: ITU-T G.191 and related documents
    organization: International Telecommunication Union
----

Under the `collection` key, you can specify:

* `name`, the site title;
* `organization`, the owner of the site.

== Final thoughts

Thanks for making it this far -- we've tried to build these commands in a way
that match our users' feedback (as well as how we wished to use internally).

While this post discusses several customization options, if you would like to
see more or have any feedback -- please file an issue at

= Metanorma now supports LaTeX input (`tex2mn` in alpha!)

Standards authors, especially those who have been writing exclusively 
in LaTeX/TeX in their lives (you know who you are, cryptographers),
have long requested for the ability to create Metanorma output using LaTeX
syntax instead of our beloved AsciiDoc.

This has been particular challenging for us since they have been constant
in their feedback: comments, suggestions, recommendations, and eventually the
very strongly worded demands...

Today we finally acknowledge their request with actions and finally free
ourselves from TeXtual abuse (just kidding).

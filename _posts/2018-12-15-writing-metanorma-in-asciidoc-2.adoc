= Writing in AsciiDoc, Part&nbsp;2

== Iterating

The diagram we showed in the last post was somewhat misleading. The concluding stage of
creating a Metanorma AsciiDoc document looks more like this:

If you're doing anything moderately complicated, your document may not end up
looking like what you expect. Even if your document is not that complicated,
you may end up with an error in markup that causes Metanorma to complain,
or to crash. And even if those things do not happen, the syntax of the document
you have authored may violate the requirements of the standard body, as captured
in the formal grammar used inside Metanorma.

To deal with this, you need to run Metanorma over your AsciiDoc input frequently,
as you build up its content and markup, so you can narrow down where anything
went wrong to what you have updated most recently. If that doesn't work in
narrowing it down, you need to cut the document into smaller and smaller pieces,
until you have identified the bit of the document causing the problem. By gradually
building up the document, and testing it as you go, you can prevent unpleasant
surprises later on.

The fix depends on what has gone wrong, of course; some of the first things to
be careful of are:

* Blank lines need to be used to set blocks of text off from each other.
AsciiDoc marks up paragraph-level objects (blocks), such as tables, lists,
and notes: these must be separate by a blank line from any preceding paragraphs,
otherwise  they will be treated as part of that paragraph, and the markup
that introduces them will be ignored.

* Characters that are being misinterpreted as markup -- such as square brackets at the start
of a line.

* The right level is applied to each heading (as indicated by the number of equals
signs before it).

:underscore: _

* An initial markup tag is matched by its ending tag; for example, if `{underscore}` (underscore) starts an
italicized passage, make sure the passage also contains the ending `{underscore}`. If the initial
tag involves multiple characters as a delimiter (we'll come to those), its corresponding
ending tag must have the same number of characters.

* Any crossreferences in the text (we'll come to those too) are correct.

* Markup should be kept within a line of text, and not be interrupted by a carriage
return. So if an italicized passage spans more than one line, close the italics at the
end of each line, and restart it at the beginning of the next. If that is not possible,
particularly for any markup contained within a pair of square brackets, you will
just need to keep the marked up content as one long line.

The grammar warnings that Metanorma issues about violating the expected structure of the
document do also need to be looked at, at least once. However, the structure
of the document needs to be complete  for it to be valid;  so you can defer resolving
any grammar issues until you have finished putting the document together.

Checking the grammar involves you hopping between the AsciiDoc input, and the XML
intermediate form (which is what is parsed for grammatical issues). Checking that the
document works as expected involves you hopping between the AsciiDoc input, and
one of the outputs, either HTML, PDF, or DOC. (The HTML is easier to work with
for error tracing than the DOC; but eventually, you will have to check both.)

== Levels of markup

AsciiDoc has three levels of markup:

* sections, such as clauses and subclauses, marked up by headings;

* blocks, which are paragraphs and spans with the same scope as paragraphs,
like lists and tables;

* and inline markup, such as italics and hyperlinks, which is contained within a block.

AsciiDoc keeps these three levels distinct. You can't have italics markup
span across two blocks, for example. (As we saw, bad things can happen to some
inline markup if it even spans across two lines.) A block cannot contain another
block; that's why there needs to be a blank line between a paragraph and a list
(although lists can have multiple levels of nesting.) And every block is meant to
be contained in a section -- except for blocks before the first section header,
which defines a section of its own (the preamble, in typical AsciiDoc terms; Metanorma
uses it as the foreword).

We have seen that the document can have attributes, defined in the document header.
Sections and blocks can also have attributes; they are indicated by a line
contained in square brackets before the section header or block, which contains
the attribute values. Blocks can also have captions (a line preceded by period/full stop).
Those two features are why a normal line of text can't start with an open square
bracket or dot. And both blocks and sections can have an anchor, included in double
square brackets: that is the identifier used to cross-reference the block or section
from elsewhere in the text.


=== Example: Metanorma table in AsciiDoc

For example, the following is a Metanorma AsciiDoc table:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[tableD-1]]
[cols="<,^,^,^,^",headerrows=2]
.Repeatability and reproducibility of husked rice yield
|===
.2+| Description 4+| Rice sample
| Arborio | Drago footnote:[Parboiled rice.] | Balilla | Thaibonnet

| Number of laboratories retained after eliminating outliers | 13 | 11 | 13 | 13
| Mean value, g/100 g | 81,2 | 82,0 | 81,8 | 77,7

|===
--

The first line is the anchor for the table: if you want to refer to the table
from elsewhere in the document, you will use the Metanorma AsciiDoc inline markup for
cross-references, `\<<tableD-1>>`. The third line is a caption for the table.
Rendering Metanorma will automatically replace the anchor and caption with
an auto-numbered caption for the table
(e.g. _Table 3. Repeatability and reproducibility of husked rice yield_);
if you add a table before this table and regenerate the Metanorma outputs,
the caption number will automatically update. More critically, the crossreference
to that table will be automatically replaced with an auto-numbered reference,
such as _Table 3_, which again will be updated automatically if you insert more
tables beforehand.

The second line is a set of attributes of the table; they include an attribute
on how each column will be text aligned (first left-aligned, the remainder
center-aligned), followed by a Metanorma-specific attribute, indicating that
there are two header rows in the table. (typical AsciiDoc only supports one.)

The table itself, as is typical of blocks, has a starting delimiter, `|===`,
indicating where this particular block starts, and a matching end delimiter,
`|===`, both on a separate line. Between the two delimiters, there is table-specific
markup: as you can guess, `|` indicates a new cell, while `4+` indicates that
the following cell spans four columns, and `.2+` that the following cell
spans two rows.

NOTE: This table example originates from the https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc-rice[IsoDoc Rice document],
which demonstrates document elements used in ISO International Standards.

Markup on sections looks similar.


=== Example: Metanorma bibliography in AsciiDoc

The following is how a bibliography may be marked up:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[infobib]]
[bibliography,obligation=infomrative]
== Informative Bibliography

* [[[ISO3696,ISO 3696]]], _Water for analytical laboratory use -- Specification and test methods_

== Next heading...
--

Again, the first line is a crossreference anchor, and the third line is a title
(although this time it is a heading, and a caption, because this is a section and not a block.)

The second line contains attributes, including the style attribute `bibliography`,
indicating what kind of a section this is. The style attribute is critical for the sections
that need it: in this case, the triple bracket notation used to define references
is only processed if it is contained in a section with a `bibliography` style attribute.
There is no distinct delimiter for sections -- or rather, the heading is what delimits
the start of the section, and the next heading (or end of document) delimits its end.

NOTE: In the Metanorma toolchain cited documents from certain standards bodies, such
as ISO, IETF and IEC can be auto-fetched, meaning that the title doesn't need to be
supplied, just like this:
--
[source,adoc]
----
* [[[ISO3696,ISO 3696]]], _AUTOFILLED BY METANORMA_
----
--


== Summary

This information will help you go back over the document you are marking up, and
give it the structure it needs to make sense as a standards document.

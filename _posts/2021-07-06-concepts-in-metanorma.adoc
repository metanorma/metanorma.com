excerpt: >-
    Metanorma defines common formatting and conventions across standards;
    the various flavors provide functionality specific to each standards body.
    That includes different validation, different formatting options,
    and different styling.

Metanorma aims to provide a "What You See Is What You Mean" approach to authoring
standards. That means not just encoding content with an emphasis on meaning over
appearance: it means making the semantics of the content explicit and machine-readable,
so that standards documents can serve as the basis for deriving meaning downstream.

One of the most straightforward instances of meaning represented in standards documents
is the definitions of concepts, which can be appealed to by other sources—including other
standards documents. Metanorma already provides an explicit mechanism for encoding
concept definitions in its link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms[encoding of terms],
and that will be enhanced in the months ahead through the https://github.com/glossarist[glossarist]
project.

Metanorma however also provides for tracking instances where defined concepts are mentioned
in a document. This allows us to capture the semantics of those concept mentions, tying them explicitly
back to the definition of the concept—whether it occurs in the same document, in an external document,
or in a termbase. That means that the semantic encoding of the document is enriched, and that enrichment
can be exploited downstream, e.g. in the presentation of document meaning.

The encoding of concept mentions is documented in 
link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms#citetems[Referencing concepts], and has recently
been overhauled. The syntax for concept mentions is flexible, and can be as extensive as:

`{{<<identifier>>,term,rendering,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}`

But for internal document citations, `{{term}}` and `{{term,rendering}}` will normally be sufficient.

The `term:[term]` and `term:[term,rendering]` macros, which were created to encode canonical mentions of
terms in ISO documents (e.g. "_term_ (3.1)"), have also been aligned to the concept mention 
encoding of Metanorma, so that will now be treated in Metanorma as semantically enriched elements, 
and not just rendering shortcuts. That means that `term:[term]` and `term:[term,rendering]` are now
synonyms of `{{term}}` and `{{term,rendering}}`; for that reason, the arguments of  `term:[term,rendering]`
have been reversed for this update, to align them to the `{{...}}` syntax.

= What Metanorma is

So. We've said what Metanorma is for, but we have not said much
about what Metanorma is like as a tool. This is the overall
structure of what it does.

* Metanorma is software that transforms input text into output formats.
It currently supports output to HTML, PDF (via HTML), and Microsoft
Word (in the older DOC format.)
* The input text is in a markup format, which represents the intent
of the author around formatting and structure. Currently, the only 
input markup supported is http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor].
** Marked up text is text, not a Word document, which means you will
need to get familiar with text editors (Notepad, TextEdit), if you aren't already.
* The transformation to output formats happens via an intermediate 
Metanorma XML file, which is easier to manipulate programmatically,
and which can be formally validated.
* Metanorma comes in various flavours, one for each standards body it supports.
The standards bodies currently supported are: ISO/IEC, the Chinese GuoBiao standards,
IETF, Calconnect, the Cloud Security Alliance, M3AAWG, OGC, and the
United Nations Economic Commision for Europe.
** Metanorma defines common formatting and conventions across standards; 
the various flavours provide functionality specific to each standards body.
That includes different validation, different formatting options,
and different styling.
* Metanorma is invoked on the command line, and you will need to set up
a programming environment for Metanorma to work on the command line.
** We are currently setting up a gateway to run Metanorma online, so that
you can submit Metanorma input files to a web server, and get output files back.
But in the long run, if you are managing the workflow around your document,
you will still need to set up processing of the document locally.

== Setting Metanorma up

To get started, you need to set up your local programming environment.

* If you are on Mac, follow the instructions on https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
* If you are on Linux, follow the instructions on https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-linux-setup
* If you are on Windows follow the instructions on https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-windows-setup

Once you are set up (which will take a little while), you should be able to create and compile
a Metanorma document:

* Create the following as a new document, saving it to a file as `test.adoc`:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
= Test

== Clause 1
----

This document is in Asciidoctor markup: `=` indicates the document title, and `==` indicates
a first level heading within the document. Asciidoctor is 
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[documented online], so we won't be giving detailed
tutorials of how Asciidoctor markup works, but we will provide you the basics to get started.

* In your command line interface, navigate to where you have created the document,
and compile it as an ISO document:

In Mac and Linux:
[source,console]
----
$ cd <wbere you saved test.adoc>
$ metanorma -t iso test.adoc
----

In Windows, if you have done the native installation:

[source,console]
----
???
----

In Windows, if you have used the docker installation:

[source,console]
----
$ docker run -v ${pwd}:/metanorma/ ribose/metanorma "metanorma -t iso test.adoc"
----

== What Metanorma outputs

You will see test.xml, test.doc, test.html and test.alt.html created in the same folder as 
test.adoc. All these documents will contain just one line of content, the title "Clause 1"; but
the HTML and DOC will also be styled to match the ISO document templates defined for Metanorma,
including a (very sparsely populated) cover page. The two HTML pages are styled differently:
the test.doc file is more sparsely formatted, and close to the Word template of ISO, while
the test.alt.html document is somewhat more colourful.

And the thing is, you did not have to format a thing, to generate three different renderings
of the document, including a Word document that follows the ISO stylesheet slavishly. Metanorma
has taken care of the formatting for you. You just need to make sure you get the content right.
(Which means providing more content than just a clause title.)

It's like magic. Command-line, pedantic magic, to be sure, and magic that sometimes throws up
cryptic error messages. But still magic.

The test.xml document is the formally compliant representation of the document contents, and
unlike the HTML and DOC versions, there is no formatting in there. If you open it up, you will
see some metadata about the document ---

[source,xml]
----
  <contributor>
    <role type="author"/>
    <organization>
      <name>International Organization for Standardization</name>
      <abbreviation>ISO</abbreviation>
    </organization>
  </contributor>
----

(we said that this is an ISO document, so Metanorma has gone ahead and provided the information
that this is a document with ISO as its corporate author) --- though much of the metadata is empty.
You will also see the one line of content underneath the metadata:

[source,xml]
---
<sections>
  <clause id="_clause_1" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
  <title>Clause 1</title>
  </clause>
</section>
</clause>
---

Even here, Metanorma has supplied some default information that may come in handy for rendering:
the clause heading is rendered as a separate line, not inline; the clause it introduces is assumed
by default to be normative, not informative; and the clause has an identifier, which can be used
for cross-referencing within the document --- which the renderer will know to update with the
current value of the clause number.

While you were generating the document, you will have noticed several error messagers roll past
the console:

[source,console]
----
ISO style: Initial section must be (content) Foreword
ISO style: Prefatory material must be followed by (clause) Scope
ISO style: Normative References must be followed by Terms and Definitions
ISO style: Document must contain at least one clause
----

ISO specifcally expects to see a whole lot of sections in any standards document that you have 
not provided, and you are being correctly warned about that. There are also errors raised
against specific line numbers of the XML document (since that is what is being formally validated
against a document schema):

[source,console]
----
ielement "sections" not allowed yet; missing required element "preface" @ 46:11
element "clause" incomplete; expected element "admonition", "clause", "dl", "example", "figure", "formula", "ol", "p", "quote", "review", "sourcecode", "table" or "ul" @ 49:10
element "sections" incomplete; expected element "clause" or "terms" @ 50:12
element "iso-standard" incomplete; missing required element "bibliography" @ 51:16
----

For example, `@ 49:10` refers to line 49, character 10 (the `</clause>` tag,
where the one clause in the document has ended). It is complaining about the fact
that the clause after its title is empty: clauses are expected to contain
at least one block of text, and the error message lists the kinds of blocks of text
it would expect to see. Much of the time, you will still get output from Metanorma
despite its complaints about structure; but if you want to make sure your document
is compliant, you should go through the warnings generated at least once.

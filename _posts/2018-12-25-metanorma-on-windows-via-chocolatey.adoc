== Metanorma Docker vs Native: maintenance and performance

Metanorma has been available on Windows as a Docker container,
but running Docker for Metanorma has proven to be very
resource-draining for users, and at least, an ongoing
maintenance nightmare for those not familiar with it.

On macOS, the native installation runs few times *faster*
than the Docker container version, allowing for some very
realistic gains when iterating standard documents, and
we have been wanting to bring the same for those on
Windows.

== A primer on Chocolatey

For a very long time, the world of Windows did not have a
command-line package management system as in `yum` or `apt` on
Linux, or like Homebrew on macOS.
In 2011, a tool called "`Chocolatey`" was released, and life
on Windows has since been changed...

Chocolatey is a package manager and installer for software packages
built for Windows. As its base, it is an execution engine using the
NuGet packaging infrastructure and Windows PowerShell to provide an
automation tool for installing software on Windows machines.


== Installing Metanorma on Windows using Chocolatey

Enter the Metanorma Chocolatey package, the officially
supported Windows package for installing Metanorma natively
on your Windows machine.

The very short and simple steps:

. Install Chocolatey according to their
https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation[Chocolatey installation guide].

. Once Chocolatey is installed, install Metanorma using one single command (`-y` for "`yes to all`") (well, some more commands need to be run before that one): +

= Metanorma more accessible than ever with WCAG compliance

To much fanfare, Metanorma now supports WCAG 2.0 (ISO/IEC 40500:2012)
accessibility features fitting right in the WYSIWYM mantra.

Accessibility directives in Metanorma can be encoded directly in either
AsciiDoc (or LaTeX, did we
https://www.metanorma.com/blog/2019-10-08-metanorma-with-latex-support-alpha/[announce]
that already?).

Accessibility is an absolute necessity in today's world, and
especially so for standardization documents in order to have
them accessible by people of all circumstances.

These accessibility features are Metanorma-wide features, meaning
that they can be used in all flavors.


== How does accessibility relate to Metanorma?

Computer accessibility, according to 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility[Wikipedia],
refers to
"`the accessibility of a computer system to all people,
regardless of disability type or severity of impairment`".

Metanorma provides multi-format output for standardization documents.
These documents, due to their nature of containing widely applicable
requirements or guidance, are obliged to provide their readers with
means of understanding without obstruction.

Accessibility is crucial to Metanorma users, which include
international organizations, intergovernmental organizations
as well as government agencies, who are all regulated by
accessibilty requirements.

As an example, in the US, accessibility requirements for information and
communication technology are covered under 
https://www.section508.gov[Section 508] of the Rehabilitation Act and Section
255 of the Communications Act, to ensure that technologies used are accessible
to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.


== Standards on accessibility

https://www.w3.org/WAI/[W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) group] 
has developed the
https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)],
which are today's golden rule on web accessibility requirements.

Document formats like Microsoft Word implement other
similar accessibility features, such as link and table descriptions,
to the same effect.


== Using accessibility features in Metanorma

=== Image alt text

Images can only be understood in words without visual interpretation.
Authors should attempt their best in providing alt text for images,
which describe what an image is about.

Here's how you do it:

[source,adoc]
----
image::images/rice-husk-purity.png[Color image demonstrating rice purity]
----

In HTML, the alt text will be rendered in the `alt` attribute (as expected!).

In Word, the alt text will be rendered in the image as Word "`Alt Text`".

To verify, you could:

1. Right click the image
2. Select "`Edit Alt Text`" in the context menu
3. Verify that the alt text is shown inside the text box.

// TODO: HTML screenshot

// TODO: Word screenshot


=== Hyperlink alt text

These are relativey common but arguably one of the most important
accessibility features. Alt text for hyperlinks explain what the hyperlink
represents and can be read out by screen readers.

Here's the syntax to provide alt text for a hyperlink:

[source,adoc]
----
http://www.example.com[text,title="alttext"]
----

In HTML, this alt text is rendered as the `title` attribute of the `<a>`
tag.

In Word, this alt text will be included as a "`ScreenTip`". This ScreenTip
will be added for links as well as for links to references (the bibliography).

To verify, you could:

1. Right click the link
2. Select "`ScreenTip`" in the context menu
3. Verify that the alt text shows in the ScreenTip.

// TODO: HTML screenshot

// TODO: Word screenshot



//NOTE: Implemented https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/108


=== Table alt text

Alt text is supported for Tables, for both HTML and Word outputs.

[source,adoc]
----
[alt=Text]
|===
...
|===
----

In HTML output, the alt text will be set as a `title` attribute
for the table.

In Word, you can verify that alt text is set for a table by:

. Right-click the Table
. Select "`Table Properties`"
. Choose the "`Alt Text`" tab
. The entered alt text should be provided in the "`Title`" field.


// TODO: HTML screenshot

// TODO: Word screenshot

//NOTE: Implemented https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/109


=== Table title and summary

Tables with data can be hard to understand without visual assistance,
and in Metanorma the "`title`" and "`summary`" attributes are used
to include such information in the accessible outputs.

The `summary` attribute is intended to provide an extensive description
of the table's content.

The `title` attribute is used to provide a caption for the table.


Here's how to add "`title`" and "`summary`" to a Metanorma table.

[source,adoc]
----
[headerrows=2,alt=Table of maximum mass fraction of defects in husked rice,summary=Table enumerating the permissible mass fraction of defects in husked and various classes of milled rice]
|===
.2+|Defect
4+^| Maximum permissible mass fraction of defects in husked rice + stem:[w_max]

| in husked rice 
| in milled rice (non-glutinous) 
| in husked parboiled rice 
| in milled parboiled rice

|===
----

The `title` attribute is supported by both HTML and Word outputs.

// TODO: HTML screenshot

// TODO: Word screenshot

[NOTE]
====
Metanorma only generates HTML 5 output (across all flavors). The `summary`
attribute is only natively supported in HTML 4 but removed from HTML 5,
which is not ideal despite the several awkward workarounds, such as
https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/caption-summary/[W3C Caption summary] and
this https://www.davidmacd.com/test/details.html[article from CanAdapt].

In Metanorma-generated HTML 5, the `summary` is encoded inside the table
caption, made invisible in HTML output, while keeping it readable for screen
readers.

//NOTE: Implemented https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/143

== Conclusion

While the new accessibility features provided in Metanorma are no
doubt of great assistance, it does take one thing away -- 
the excuse of not using them in your standards!

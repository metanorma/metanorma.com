    We present a simple method to save DOC files as DOCX with MS Word.

== Saving Word Documents

Metanorma generates .doc not .docx files (for rationale see https://github.com/metanorma/html2doc/wiki/Why-not-docx%3F ). So, you will need to save any .doc files as .docx if you can't deal with .doc format. Below we present a procedure for saving DOCX files in both Windows and macOS.

=== For Windows

* Use Metanorma to generate .doc file.

* Open the doc in Word. Do "Save As", change the file type to "docx", and save.

* Check all images and resize them if necessary.

If there are any further changes or touch-ups you'd want to apply to the Word output, go ahead!

* Regenerate all indexes in Table of Contents (List of Tables/Images if exists). Just right click over the indexes and "Update Field".

* Save the docx file. (Optionally save as PDF.)

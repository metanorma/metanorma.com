    Post-processing of Metanorma Microsoft Word output

== Saving Word Documents

Metanorma encourages management of document content in a declarative,
single-truth, manner -- yet in many cases, it is important to produce
Microsoft Word output:

* to solicit feedback, from people who do are unfamiliar with Metanorma and Git
** e.g., for standards balloting and review, via Word's "`Track Changes`" features

* to generate a "`redline`" document from two document revisions
** e.g., for review compared across document stages

* to submit to legacy publication workflows
** e.g., to ISO Central Secretariat at DIS stage and beyond

Metanorma generates `.doc` not `.docx` files
(see https://github.com/metanorma/html2doc/wiki/Why-not-docx%3F[rationale]).

Since the `.doc` format used by Metanorma is only readable by Microsoft Word
and not other Word-compatible software (such as OpenOffice), it is necessary
to convert the output to the Microsoft Word OpenXML `.docx` format
for distribution.

This post describes steps for saving DOCX files in both Windows and macOS
using a real document example!


=== Post-processing Metanorma Word files in Windows

==== Generate the `.doc` file using Metanorma

Use Metanorma to generate the `.doc` file.

==== Convert `.doc` file into `.docx`

First of all you will want to re-save the `.doc` into `.docx` to
ensure any further changes are retained.

NOTE: If you directly save as the original `.doc` format, Word may
switch to "`Web Layout`" instead of "`Page Layout`", which you can
change back to "`Page Layout`" under the "`View`" menu.

Open the generated Word `.doc` file.

Click on the top bar menu "`File`" then "`Save As...`".

In the "`Save As...`" dialog, change the file type to "`Word Document (*.docx)`".

Then click "`Save`".

==== Content fixes: resizing images

By default, images in the Metanorma generated Word file are
stretched to full width of the page.

This is usually fine for wide images, but for narrower images
you may want to shrink them to more readable sizes.

If there are any of such images you would have to shrink them
manually, like this:

.Resize images that are too wide

NOTE: You can set image widths inside Metanorma input!


==== Content fixes: further touch-ups

It's now a good time to double check the Word content to
ensure the results match your expectations.

If there are any further changes or touch-ups you'd want to
apply to the Word output, go ahead!


==== Updating the Table of Contents

After post-processing, we will need to update the Word indexes
as per typical Word workflow.

You will need to trigger an update of the Table of Contents
manually.

Find the "`Table of Contents`",
right-click over its contents and click "`Update Field`".

.Regenerate the Table of Contents

NOTE: Don't forget to regenerate the "`List of Tables`" and
"`Lists of Figures`" if they exist!

==== Final save!

Finally we can save the `.docx` file and distribute it!

NOTE: Optionally save as PDF if you need PDF output.




=== Post-processing Metanorma Word files in macOS

==== Generate the `.doc` file using Metanorma

Use Metanorma to generate the `.doc` file.

Open the generated Word `.doc` file.

Click on the top bar menu "`File`" then "`Save As...`".

In the "`Save As...`" dialog, change the file type to "`Word Document (.docx)`".

Change the filename extension to `.docx`.

Then click "`Save`". If Word prompts you to change the extension to `.docx`, accept it.

Sometimes Word shows you a dialog of "`Select one of the following options:`",
"`Update page numbers only`" or "`Update entire table`", select "`Update entire table`"
for a full refresh.

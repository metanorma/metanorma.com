= Announcing Metanorma support for TeX math

Until recently, Metanorma has only processed AsciiMath and MathML, but
Metanorma now accepts the following methods for writing mathematical formulas that are

These are generally the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM[WYSIWYM]
methods for writing mathematical formulas:

* http://asciimath.org[AsciiMath];

* https://www.w3.org/Math/[MathML]; and

* https://www.latex-project.org[TeX/LaTeX math]


== Metanorma uses AsciiMath by default

AsciiMath, that most elegant, parsimonious, human-readable and human-pleasing format (why yes, your humble wizard is biased), is recognised by default. anything inside of a `stem` macro or `stem` block is assumed by default to be in AsciiMath:

[source,adoc]
----
This is an inline formula in AsciiMath: stem:[sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2]

This is a formula block in AsciiMath:

[stem]
++++
sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2
++++
----

== MathML is the canonical math format used in Metanorma

MathML (https://www.iso.org/standard/58439.html[ISO 40314:2016]) is not
parsimonious or human-readable, but it is widespread, well-supported,
and a very complete math language.

In fact, by default Metanorma converts all math into in MathML
inside Metanorma XML.
But notice how verbose (and less readable) it is compared with AsciiMath.

Metanorma will also recognize MathML injected into a `stem` macro or block, provided the root element is `<math>`.

[source,adoc]
----
The is a formula block in MathML:

[stem]
++++
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
  <munderover>
    <mo>âˆ‘</mo>
    <mrow>
      <mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn>
    </mrow>
    <mi>n</mi>
  </munderover>
  <msup><mi>i</mi><mn>3</mn></msup>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <msup>
    <mfenced open="(" close=")">
      <mfrac>
        <mrow>
          <mi>n</mi>
          <mfenced open="(" close=")">
            <mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow>
          </mfenced>
        </mrow>
        <mn>2</mn>
      </mfrac>
    </mfenced>
    <mn>2</mn>
  </msup>
</math>
++++

NOTE: You can keep AsciiMath (prevent its conversion to MathML)
through the document attribute `:mn-keep-asciimath:`,
or the metanorma option `metanorma --asciimath`.


== Enter TeX math!

.TeX math is processed by Metanorma as MathML

TeX math is now fully supported by Metanorma.
Metanorma AsciiDoc allows you to mix AsciiMath and TeX math in the same document.
By default, it converts both to MathML.

Following the convention set in AsciiDoc,
you can indicate that a mathematical expression is TeX math or AsciiMath,
in these two ways.


=== Using TeX math with AsciiMath

You can enter TeX math using the `[latexmath]` style attribute,
instead of `[stem]` with AsciiMath.

[source,adoc]
----
// `latexmath:[...]` must be kept on a single line
The is an inline TeX formula
latexmath:[\displaystyle{\sum_{{{i}={1}}}^{{n}}}{i}^{3}={\left(\frac{{{n}{\left({n}+{1}\right)}}}{{2}}\right)}^{2}]

This is a TeX math block:

[latexmath]
++++
\displaystyle{\sum_{{{i}={1}}}^{{n}}}{i}^{3}={\left(\frac{{{n}{\left({n}+{1}\right)}}}{{2}}\right)}^{2}
++++
----

=== Using TeX math everywhere

By setting the document attribute `:stem: latexmath`,
all `[stem]` expressions are taken as being TeX math
instead of AsciiMath.

In this case, you need to use `[asciimath]` to
indicate that a mathematical expression is in AsciiMath.

[source,adoc]
----
// again, `stem:[...]` must be kept on a single line
This is an inline TeX formula:
stem:[\displaystyle{\sum_{{{i}={1}}}^{{n}}}{i}^{3}={\left(\frac{{{n}{\left({n}+{1}\right)}}}{{2}}\right)}^{2}]

This is a TeX math block:

[stem]
++++
\displaystyle{\sum_{{{i}={1}}}^{{n}}}{i}^{3}={\left(\frac{{{n}{\left({n}+{1}\right)}}}{{2}}\right)}^{2}
++++

And this is an inline AsciiMath formula:
asciimath:[sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2]
----

NOTE: Read more about
link:/author/topics/document-format/text/#mathematical-expressions[mathematical expressions]
in AsciiDoc.


== Under the hood: TeX math in Metanorma

Now, to convert TeX math to MathML, and make it usable downstream,
your system needs to be able to process TeX math.

Under the hood, Metanorma uses https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/[LaTeXML],
developed at the
https://www.nist.gov[National Institute for Science and Technology]
by Dr. Bruce Miller. Best tool that outputs XML representation
of TeX documents.

NOTE: The specific command Metanorma uses for LaTeXML is
`latexmlmath --preload=amsmath -- -`.


== Caveats on Windows

As usual, there is something extra that Windows users
need to be aware of.

On Windows, it is important to use UTF-8 encoding in the `cmd` shell,
otherwise TeX math will not be processed correctly.

To ensure that `cmd` is using UTF-8 encoding, make sure you
execute this command before processing any documents
with TeX math in them under Metanorma:

[source,sh]
----
chcp 65001
----

== Conclusion

The Metanorma installation automatically installs LaTeXML
for you and allows TeX math to be used immediately.

Most TeX math packages are already supported by LaTeXML,
there is no TeX distribution necessary at all.

Feel free to TeX your math away in Metanorma!

NOTE: Pssst... we also helped https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML[LaTeXML]
create the
https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/get.html[LaTeXML Chocolatey package]
to reciprocate their team's kindness in working with us!

////
Most LaTeX packages are supported in the LaTeXML installation,
without you needing to install a TeX distribution at all; only the following packages are not supported by LaTeXML,
and none of them deal directly with the typesetting of formulae, or the generation of MathML:

* color.sty
* colordvi.sty
* ntheorem.sty
* pgfkeys.code
* pgfmath.code
* siunitx.sty
* tikz.sty
* xcolor.sty

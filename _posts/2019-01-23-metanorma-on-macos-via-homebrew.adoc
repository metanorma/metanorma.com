= Metanorma available for macOS as Homebrew formula

Metanorma is now available for installation on macOS via the Homebrew package installer.

You humble wizards here in Metanorma HQ happen to be of the Macintosh persuasion,
and for there to be a Windows package management solution for Metanorma (our
link:posts/2018-12-25-metanorma-on-windows-via-chocolatey[Chocolatey package]
was announced on Christmas, BTW), without an equivalent for the Mac, is something of an imbalance.

An imbalance that has now been addressed: Metanorma is now available on https://brew.sh[Homebrew],
the storied macOS package management solution.

For the curious: our sourcecode for the Homebrew installer is on https://github.com/riboseinc/homebrew-metanorma.


== Installing Metanorma on macOS using Homebrew

The Metanorma Homebrew formula is officially supported
for installing Metanorma natively on your macOS machine.

As a native install, it is much faster than running Metanorma
via the Metanorma Docker container.

Short and sweet, simple steps:

. If you don't already have Homebrew installed, install Homebrew
  according to the https://brew.sh[Homebrew] homepage. +

For your convenience, this is how you install Homebrew, at least today:
[source,console]
----
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----
--

. Install Metanorma from Homebrew: +
+
--
[source,console]
----
brew tap riboseinc/metanorma
brew install metanorma
----

NOTE: Alternatively, if you want to install Metanorma straight from the spigot (er, URL), you can do:
[source,console]
----
brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/homebrew-metanorma/master/metanorma.rb
----
--

Happy brewing!

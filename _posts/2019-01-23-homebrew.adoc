= Metanorma now available for Mac as Homebrew package

We announced on Christmas that Metanorma is now available for installation on Windows NT via the Chocolatey
package installer. You humble wizards here in Metanorma HQ happen to be of the Macintosh persuasion,
and for there to be a Windows package management solution for Metanorma, without an equivalent for the Mac
or Linux, is something of an imbalance.

An imbalance that has now been addressed: Metanorma is now available on https://brew.sh[Homebrew],
the storied OSX and Linux package management solution.

If you don't already have Homebrew installed, https://brew.sh[Homebrew] provides appropriate instruction.
Then again, if you don't already have Homebrew installed at least on MacOS, you're probably not getting much done.

Our sourcecode for the Homebrew installer is on https://github.com/riboseinc/homebrew-metanorma.
All you need to do to install Metanorma through Homebrew is:

[source,console]
----
brew tap riboseinc/metanorma
brew install metanorma
----

Alternatively, if you want to install Metanorma straight from the spigot (er, URL), you can do:

[source,console]
----
brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/homebrew-metanorma/master/metanorma.rb

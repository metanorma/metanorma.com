= New IEC flavour of Metanorma

Metanorma has released a new flavour of standards document specific to the 
https://www.iec.ch[International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)]. It is
available as the gem `metanorma-iec`, and is invoked in the metanorma command
as `metanorma -t iec document.adoc`.

IEC documents are governed by the same format specification as ISO documents,
namely https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO/IEC DIR 2].
Accordingly, the IEC gem is derived from the ISO gem, and uses substantially
the same code.

The noteworthy differences are:

* The IEC flavour uses the stage codes specific to the IEC, as listed in
https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/processes/stage_codes.htm[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Stage Codes]
and 
https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/processes/workflows.htm[IEC Processes & Procedures -- Workflow].
The IEC also recognises https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[ISO International Harmonized Stage Codes],
which are mapped to IEC stage codes.

* The IEC flavour processes part and subpart numbers for documents, entered in the
`:partnumber:` attribute as `{nnn}-{mmm}`.

* The IEC flavour uses the IEC template for Word documents, including equivalent
Word paragraph styles where applicable. (The names used for paragraph styles
are named consistently with the rest of Metanorma.)

* The IEC flavour injects IEC-specific boilerplate language into the XML source
(in English or French),
and displays it at the appropriate location in Word and HTML output.

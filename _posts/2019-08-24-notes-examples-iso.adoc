= Notes and examples in ISO

The styling of notes and examples under ISO is not explicitly described in 
https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO/IEC DIR 2].
The styling of ISO Word documents (which is reflected in their PDF and print
output) is determined by the ISO editors, although example styling is also not
made explicit in the Word stylesheet issued by ISO.

Both notes and examples in ISO appear in a font size one point smaller than
the main body text; in our output, the main body text is 11pt, and notes and
examples are 10pt.

Notes are styled with a _Note_ style in Word. Asciidoctor allows multiple
block types to be contained within a note, consistent with its treatment of
other admonitions; a note can contain tables, lists, and so on. However,
the Metanorma grammar assumes that notes only consist of paragraphs, and
the examples given in ISO/IEC DIR 2 are consistent with that: they are 
consistently single paragraphs:

NOTE: This is a single paragraph.

[NOTE]
====
This is a multiple paragraph note, as is permitted by Asciidoctor
and Metanorma. 

However, there are no such instances in ISO/IEC DIR 2, and they
should probably be avoided in ISO documents, which rely on a prefixed
"NOTE" indication to be identified.

Examples are styled with an _Example_ style in Word. Example paragraphs, too,
are 10pt. Both Metanorma and ISO/IEC DIR 2 permit multiple blocks in an example,
and they can be heterogeneous, including blockquotes, source code, lists, 
formulas, and notes. (There is no provision in the Metanorma grammar at this time
for tables nested in examples, and labelling them would be problematic.)

Unlike ISO/IEC DIR 2 (25.6, Example 2), Metanorma does not support nested examples.

ISO will respect the indentation of examples in submissions. In Metanorma,
we have implemented both table-based and div-based rendering of examples;
we are using div-based rendering, meaning that examples are not indented
currently, and are identified only through smaller font.

This is a multiple paragraph example. It can contain blocks
of different types:

[quote,ISO/IEC DIR 2]

Examples illustrate concepts presented in the document. The document shall be usable without the examples.

[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))]

image:https://travis-ci.com/riboseinc/metanorma.com.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.com/riboseinc/metanorma.com"]

== Introduction

This is the Metanorma project site (a Ribose Open Project Site) located at https://www.metanorma.com.

It is implemented as a https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll] site.

== Development

=== Getting started

* Ensure you have reasonable Ruby version
* Run `bundle` from within site directory to install Ruby dependencies

=== Serving site preview

* Run `jekyll serve` from within site directory



=== Structure

This repository contains a `_config.yml` for specifying the directory structure,
metadata, build defaults, etc.

Site data is located in this directory and the resulting build is created
under `_site/`.

==== Inputs

All source files are inside the `_jekyll/` directory, as specified in
`_config.yml`.

==== Outputs

All output files live inside the `_site/` directory, and its content have been
`gitignore`-d.



== Usage

=== Preparation

To begin developing,

[source,sh]
----
make prep
----

which would install the necessary Ruby gems for you.

=== Auto-build

To make it watch for file changes and build automatically (which watches only
the files specified in the above Inputs section), run:

[source,sh]
----
make watch
----

If you want to be sure all outputs are cleaned prior to building, run:

[source,sh]
----
make clean-watch
----

=== Just build

The non-watching equivalents for the above are simply:

[source,sh]
----
make build
----

[source,sh]
----
make clean-build
----


== Deployment

This section is only for deployment.

=== Configuration

Configure the hostname and region in the `ro-site.rc` file as you know it.

[source,sh]
----
cp ro-site.rc.template ro-site.rc
vi ro-site.rc
----

=== Uploading to S3

If you have access to the bucket, run this.

[source,sh]
----
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
source ro-site.rc
make upload
----

=== Clear CloudFront caching

The sites are accessed via CloudFront. If you're seeing
stale data after `make upload`, most likely the CloudFront
cache needs to be invalidated.

Your AWS account must be authorized to invalidate the CloudFront
cache for this distribution.

[source,sh]
----
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
source ro-site.rc
make clear-cf
----


== Workflow

. Ensure tests pass
. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
. Create new Pull Request
